# Roundabout Performance Breakpoint Analysis

## Summary

This report identifies critical arrival rates where roundabout performance begins to degrade unacceptably.

### Breakpoint Definitions

A **breakpoint** is the arrival rate where at least one of these conditions is violated:

- Average delay > 15.0s (Level of Service D/E boundary)
- 95th percentile delay > 90.0s (user experience threshold)
- Maximum queue > 80 vehicles (storage capacity)
- Throughput efficiency < 70% (demand satisfaction)
- Throughput begins decreasing (hypercongestion)

## 2-Lane Roundabout

### Critical Breakpoint: **λ = 0.150 veh/s per arm**

**Total demand at breakpoint:** 2160 veh/hr

#### Performance at Breakpoint

- **Throughput:** 1476 veh/hr (68.3% efficiency)
- **Average delay:** 16.1s
- **95th percentile delay:** 89.1s
- **Maximum queue:** 71 vehicles (~357m)

#### Breakpoint Criteria Triggered

- **λ = 0.150**: avg delay (16.1s), efficiency (68.3%)
- **λ = 0.200**: avg delay (27.1s), P95 delay (152.7s), queue (89 veh), efficiency (60.6%)

#### Recommended Operating Range

**Maximum safe arrival rate:** λ ≤ 0.120 veh/s per arm
**Maximum safe total demand:** 1728 veh/hr

*This includes a 20% safety margin below the critical breakpoint.*

## 3-Lane Roundabout

### Critical Breakpoint: **λ = 0.200 veh/s per arm**

**Total demand at breakpoint:** 2880 veh/hr

#### Performance at Breakpoint

- **Throughput:** 2012 veh/hr (69.9% efficiency)
- **Average delay:** 13.8s
- **95th percentile delay:** 65.7s
- **Maximum queue:** 81 vehicles (~405m)

#### Breakpoint Criteria Triggered

- **λ = 0.200**: queue (81 veh), efficiency (69.9%)
- **λ = 0.250**: avg delay (26.6s), P95 delay (103.4s), queue (144 veh), efficiency (60.4%)

#### Recommended Operating Range

**Maximum safe arrival rate:** λ ≤ 0.160 veh/s per arm
**Maximum safe total demand:** 2304 veh/hr

*This includes a 20% safety margin below the critical breakpoint.*

## Comparative Summary

| Configuration | Breakpoint (λ) | Max Safe Demand | Relative Capacity |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 2-lane | 0.150 veh/s/arm | 1728 veh/hr | 100% |
| 3-lane | 0.200 veh/s/arm | 2304 veh/hr | 133% |

### Key Insights

- **3-lane capacity advantage:** +33% over 2-lane
- **2-lane sustainable demand:** 1728 veh/hr
- **3-lane sustainable demand:** 2304 veh/hr
